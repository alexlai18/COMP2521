Question 3

(a) 
(a1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     When inserting 8, you don't need to promote anything as it is a 3-node.
     The root node is the original root, of 12,35 and 60



(a2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     The node containing 8 would also have 1 and 7


(b) 
(b1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     When inserting 50, 44 gets promoted, leading to 35 being promoted.
     Therefore, 35 is the root.


(b2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     The nodes with 50 is 36 and 57
