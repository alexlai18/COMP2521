Question 5

(a) What is the difference between an Euler path and a Hamilton path?
Hamilton path is a path between v and w in which the path includes each vertex exactly once. 
Euler path is a path between v and w in which the path includes each edge exactly once.


(b) Does the graph have any Euler paths? If so, give one of them. If not, explain why.
No. It would be impossible to touch every edge without having duplicates. 


(c) Does the graph have any Hamilton paths? If so, give one of them. If not, explain why.
