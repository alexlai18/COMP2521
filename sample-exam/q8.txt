Question 8

Describe in detail the steps you would perform to tell the sort programs apart.

First we test the stability of the sorting algorithm, by inputting a number of values in alphabetical order, with a number before it.
If it is stable, it should be ordered by number and alphabetically.

If unstable, it should be the naive quicksort.

Then, we plot the times, and look at the time complexities of the sorting algorithms. We take in different number inputs.
Merge sort should not change despite input being random, increasing or decreasing. 
Then, we test to see if there are swaps. If there are swaps, then it is bubble sort, if not it is insertion sort.


Bubblesort vs insertion sort:
If the list is sorted by increasing value except for last value which is the smallest value.
Bubblesort: O(N^2) has to check and move it up for every node, making it n^2
Insertion sort: O(n) just inserts the 2 at the front after checking it with the first value
