Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

This occurs because the function main doesn't know about the struct being declared because the declaration is not in 
Graph.h or prog.c. A way to solve this is either by defining the struct inside Graph.h, or to have a helper function in Graph.h which 
returns the values needed.
