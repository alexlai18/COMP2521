Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.
    B. Preorder traversal runs from root to the left subtree to the right subtree. We can build our BST based off this information.
    Then after traversing through the tree in post-order (searching left subtree fully), we have gotten with the sequence (B). It is also 
    the only sequence with 8 before 7 (travel through right subtree before root).


(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c)

i.  Value(s) in the root node: 20 and 35

ii. Value(s) in the node that now contains 62: 12, 60
