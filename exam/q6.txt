Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

A heap data structure is the most suitable for implementing a Priority Queue ADT.  A heap can be constructed in O(n) time. Pushing can be done in O(logn) average and worst case, popping can be done in O(logn) average and worst case.
Furthermore printing all the key-element pairs in order of priority can be done in O(nlogn) time as min heapify takes O(logn) time and there are n nodes.
